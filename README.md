# pollthingy
A simple (straw) poll web application made with [Laravel 5.7](https://laravel.com).

## Features
  * Many useful options (multiple answers, automatic closing of poll at a chosen date, hiding results until poll is closed, etc.)
  * Optional duplication checking via generated single-use voting codes
  * Sane endpoints/'RESTful API' (with optional JSON output via HTTP Accept header)
  * Simple CSS based on [Cutestrap](https://cutestrap.com)
  * No JS is used
  * Developed with support for text-based browsers in mind (including pie charts in w3m)
